## Quick Look

- ***Flappy Bird*** is a free 2D mobile game created by `dotGEARS` in 2013.
- Player can **only** move the bird up by tapping.
- Goal is to _avoid hitting the pipes or the ground_...
- ... and score as many points as possible.

## Settings

In the _main menu_ player can customize the game a bit, as there are:

- **3 bird skins**
- **2 game themes**
- **Mute button** <sub>(not recommended)</sub>

## Gameplay

Players can show their _skills_ by scoring the highest possible number <sub>(that's the maximum capacity of int)</sub>
without the fear of not being able to pause the game when needed as there's an easily accessable `pause menu`:

When hitting the pipe remember that your medal depends on your current score, so give it your best:
